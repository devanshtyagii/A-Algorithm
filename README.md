# A* Algorithm Implementation in Python

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of the A* algorithm in Python. The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm used in various applications, including robotics, gaming, and geographic information systems.

## Overview
The A* algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path between two points on a graph, taking into account both the cost to reach each point and the estimated cost to reach the goal. It does this by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to explore, prioritizing nodes with lower total cost.

## Features
- **Efficient Pathfinding**: A* algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path between two points.
- **Heuristic Function**: Customizable heuristic function to estimate the cost from a node to the goal.
- **Adaptable**: Suitable for various types of grids or graphs, including 2D grids, graphs, and more.
